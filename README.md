# Bash

## What is the bash scripting?

- Bash scripts are like movie scripts: A movie script tells actors what to say at what time, while Bash scripts tell Bash **what to do at what time**.
- Bash scripts are a **simple text file** containing a series of commands we want to automate running rather than running them.
- We need to remember to set the **execute** bit on a file before we try to run the script, and that the script should start with a **"shebang"**.
