# Bash Scripting Fundamentals

## 1. What Is Bash?
**Bash (Bourne Again SHell)** is a command interpreter and scripting language for Unix/Linux systems.  
It supports:
- Command execution  
- Variables and arithmetic  
- Conditionals and loops  
- Functions and error handling  
- Text processing with pipes, redirections, and tools (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`, etc.)

## 2. Running Bash Scripts
### Create and run a script
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "Hello world"
````

Save as `myscript.sh`, then:

```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
./myscript.sh
```

You can also run:

```bash
bash myscript.sh
```

The `#!/usr/bin/env bash` line is the **shebang** — it tells the system which interpreter to use.


## 3. Variables
### Declaring variables

```bash
name="Alice"
age=25
```

> No spaces around `=`!

### Accessing variables
```bash
echo "Name: $name, Age: $age"
```

### Read-only variables
```bash
readonly company="TechCorp"
```

### Environment variables
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/bin"
```

### Reading user input
```bash
read -p "Enter your name: " username
echo "Hi $username!"
```

## 4. Data Types (Primitives)
Bash treats everything as **strings**, but supports numeric arithmetic.

### Integer arithmetic
```bash
a=5
b=3

# In Bash, the double parentheses with $ are used for arithmetic expansion.
# It allows you to perform integer math operations directly inside your script.
sum=$((a + b))
echo "$a + $b = $sum"
```

### String operations
```bash
greet="hello"
echo "${greet^^}"   # HELLO (uppercase)
echo "${greet,,}"   # hello (lowercase)
echo "${#greet}"    # string length = 5
```

<br>

## 5. Arrays
### Create an array
```bash
fruits=("apple" "banana" "orange")
```

### Access elements
```bash
echo "${fruits[0]}"   # apple
echo "${fruits[@]}"   # all elements
```

### Add or modify
```bash
fruits+=("grape")
fruits[1]="kiwi"
```

### Array length
```bash
echo "${#fruits[@]}"
```

### Iterate over array
```bash
for item in "${fruits[@]}"; do
  echo "$item"
done
```

<br>

## 6. Conditionals
### Basic if/else
```bash
x=10

if [ $x -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "x is greater than 5"
else
  echo "x is 5 or less"
fi
```

### String comparisons
```bash
str="hello"
if [ "$str" = "hello" ]; then
  echo "Match"
fi
```

### File tests

```bash
if [ -f /etc/passwd ]; then
  echo "File exists"
fi

if [ -d /var/log ]; then
  echo "Directory exists"
fi
```

### Common file test flags

| Test | Meaning                    |
| ---- | -------------------------- |
| `-f` | File exists and is regular |
| `-d` | Directory exists           |
| `-e` | File or directory exists   |
| `-r` | File is readable           |
| `-w` | File is writable           |
| `-x` | File is executable         |


## 7. Loops
### For loop

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

With brace expansion:

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Loop $i"
done
```

Iterate files:

```bash
for file in /etc/*.conf; do
  echo "Found $file"
done
```

### While loop

```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Count: $count"
  ((count++))
done
```

### Until loop
```bash
num=0
until [ $num -ge 3 ]; do
  echo "num is $num"
  ((num++))
done
```

## 8. Functions
### Declaring a function

```bash
greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}
```

### Calling a function
```bash
greet "Alice"
```

### Returning status codes
```bash
check_file() {
  [ -f "$1" ]
}

if check_file /etc/passwd; then
  echo "File exists"
else
  echo "Missing file"
fi
```

### Returning values (via echo)
```bash
sum() {
  echo $(( $1 + $2 ))
}

result=$(sum 5 3)
echo "Sum = $result"
```

## 9. Exit Codes and Error Handling
* Each command returns an **exit code** (`0` = success, nonzero = failure).
* You can view the last command’s exit code with `$?`.

```bash
ls /notfound
echo "Exit code: $?"
```

### Stop script on error
```bash
set -e
```

### Common safe mode
```bash
set -euo pipefail
```

* `-e`: exit on error
* `-u`: error on undefined variable
* `-o pipefail`: pipeline fails if any command fails

## 10. Input and Output Redirection
### Redirect output

```bash
command > file.txt     # stdout to file
command >> file.txt    # append
command 2> errors.txt  # stderr to file
```

### Redirect both stdout and stderr
```bash
command &> output.log
```

### Pipes
```bash
ps aux | grep nginx | wc -l
```

## 11. Command Substitution
Run a command and capture its output:
```bash
today=$(date +%F)
echo "Today's date is $today"
```

## 12. Case Statements
Simpler than multiple `if` statements:
```bash
read -p "Enter option (start|stop): " action

case $action in
  start)
    echo "Starting service..."
    ;;
  stop)
    echo "Stopping service..."
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unknown action: $action"
    ;;
esac
```

## 13. Script Arguments (`$1`, `$2`, `$@`)

```bash
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First arg: $1"
echo "All args: $@"
```

Loop through arguments:

```bash
for arg in "$@"; do
  echo "Arg: $arg"
done
```

## 14. Working with Files and Commands
### Check if command exists
```bash
if command -v curl &>/dev/null; then
  echo "curl installed"
else
  echo "curl missing"
fi
```

### Example: read a file line by line
```bash
while read -r line; do
  echo "Line: $line"
done < /etc/hosts
```

## 15. Practical Tips for Wicked Scripts
1. **Always start scripts with:**
   ```bash
   set -euo pipefail
   IFS=$'\n\t'
   ```

   This prevents subtle parsing errors.

2. **Use quotes** around variable expansions (`"$var"`) to prevent word splitting.
3. **Use functions** to structure code and make it reusable.
4. **Log clearly:**

   ```bash
   echo "$(date -u +"%F %T") INFO: Starting backup"
   ```

5. **Validate input early:**

   ```bash
   [[ "$var" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "Not a number"; exit 1; }
   ```

## 16. Example: Putting It All Together

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Example system check script

set -euo pipefail

check_disk() {
  local usage
  usage=$(df / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | tr -d '%')
  if [ "$usage" -gt 80 ]; then
    echo "Disk usage high: ${usage}%"
  else
    echo "Disk usage normal: ${usage}%"
  fi
}

check_mem() {
  local free
  free=$(vm_stat | awk '/Pages free/ {print $3}' | tr -d '.')
  echo "Free memory pages: $free"
}

echo "=== System Health Check ==="
check_disk
check_mem
echo "Done."
```

## Arrays
### 1. Creating Arrays
**Indexed array (most common):**

```bash
fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
```

**Add elements manually:**

```bash
fruits[3]="orange"
```

**Or declare first, then assign:**

```bash
declare -a fruits
fruits[0]="apple"
fruits[1]="banana"
```

### 2. Accessing Elements
```bash
echo "${fruits[0]}"   # apple
echo "${fruits[2]}"   # cherry
```

> Always use **double quotes** when expanding — this prevents word-splitting errors.

### 3. Getting All Elements
```bash
echo "${fruits[@]}"   # apple banana cherry orange
```

* `@` means “all elements”.
* You can also use `*`, but `@` is safer when values contain spaces.

### 4. Number of Elements
```bash
echo "${#fruits[@]}"   # 4
```

### 5. Get All Indices
```bash
echo "${!fruits[@]}"   # 0 1 2 3
```

Useful when you want to iterate with indexes.

### 6. Modifying Arrays
**Append elements:**
```bash
fruits+=("grape" "melon")
```

**Remove an element:**
```bash
unset 'fruits[1]'   # removes banana
```

**Delete entire array:**
```bash
unset fruits
```

### 7. Iterating Over Arrays
Here’s where it gets interesting.

#### a) **Loop through values**
```bash
for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"; do
  echo "I like $fruit"
done
```

> Always quote `"${fruits[@]}"` — otherwise words with spaces split incorrectly.

#### b) **Loop through indices**
```bash
for i in "${!fruits[@]}"; do
  echo "Index $i: ${fruits[$i]}"
done
```

> This is helpful when you need to modify items by index.

#### c) **C-style loop**
```bash
for ((i=0; i<${#fruits[@]}; i++)); do
  echo "${fruits[$i]}"
done
```

> Similar to loops in C, Python, or JavaScript — uses arithmetic syntax `(( ))`.

### 8. Slicing (partial access)
You can grab a slice of an array just like strings.
```bash
echo "${fruits[@]:1:2}"   # prints elements from index 1 (banana) up to 2 items
```

### 9. Copying Arrays
```bash
new_fruits=("${fruits[@]}")
```

### 10. Checking if a value exists
```bash
value="apple"
for item in "${fruits[@]}"; do
  if [[ $item == "$value" ]]; then
    echo "Found!"
  fi
done
```

Or more compact (using pattern matching):
```bash
[[ " ${fruits[@]} " =~ " $value " ]] && echo "Found!"
```

### 11. Associative Arrays (key-value pairs)
Bash 4+ supports **associative arrays** — like dictionaries.

```bash
declare -A capitals
capitals=([France]="Paris" [Italy]="Rome" [Japan]="Tokyo")

echo "${capitals[France]}"   # Paris
```

**Loop through keys:**
```bash
for country in "${!capitals[@]}"; do
  echo "$country → ${capitals[$country]}"
done
```

### Pro Tips

| **Tip**                  | **Description**                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Always use quotes        | `"${array[@]}"` preserves each element even with spaces.           |
| Use `${!array[@]}`       | Gets indices — useful for safe indexed iteration.                  |
| Bash 4+ only             | Associative arrays require Bash 4 or later.                        |
| Arrays persist in memory | If you reassign `array=("a")`, all previous elements are replaced. |

| **Syntax** | **Return Value**           | **Data Type of Result**                 | `arr=(a b c)` |
|------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|
|`${#arr[@]}`| Length (number of elements)| String                                  | `3`           |
|`${arr[@]}` | All elements               | String (all elements separated by space)| `a b c`       | 
|`${!arr[@]}`| All indexes (keys)         | String (all keys separated by space)    | `0 1 2`       |

### Example: Combining everything

```bash
#!/bin/bash

fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry" "kiwi")

echo "All fruits: ${fruits[@]}"
echo "Total: ${#fruits[@]}"

for i in "${!fruits[@]}"; do
  echo "Fruit $i: ${fruits[$i]}"
done

# Add a new one
fruits+=("mango")

# Check existence
[[ " ${fruits[@]} " =~ " mango " ]] && echo "Mango found!"
```

## Variables

### **1. Scalar Variables (basic variables)**
Used for strings, numbers, or single values.

#### Declaration & Initialization

```bash
name="Alex"
count=42
readonly app_version="1.0.0"   # makes variable immutable
```

#### Notes
- **No spaces** around `=`
- Use `readonly` or `declare -r` for constants
- Quote values containing spaces
- No need for `$` during assignment, only during use

<br>

- **Best practice**
  - Always quote strings containing spaces

    ```bash
    message="Hello World"
    ```
  - Prefer `readonly` for values that should not change

### **2. Integer Variables**
Bash doesn’t have strict types, but you can declare variables intended for arithmetic with `-i`.

```bash
declare -i counter=10
counter+=5   # Arithmetic addition (not string concatenation)
```

- **Best practice**
  - Use `declare -i` when performing integer arithmetic to avoid quoting issues or string interpretation.

### **3. Indexed Arrays**
Ordered lists indexed by integers starting from `0`.

#### Declaration

```bash
declare -a fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
```

#### Access & Append

```bash
echo "${fruits[1]}"    # banana
fruits+=("mango")      # append
echo "${fruits[@]}"    # apple banana cherry mango
```

- **Best practice**
  - Always use quotes: `"${fruits[@]}"` (prevents word-splitting)
  - Use `declare -a` explicitly for clarity and readability

### **4. Associative Arrays**
Key–value maps (unordered), available in **Bash ≥ 4**.

#### Declaration

```bash
declare -A capitals=(
  [France]="Paris"
  [Germany]="Berlin"
  [Italy]="Rome"
)
```

#### Access
```bash
echo "${capitals[Germany]}"  # Berlin
```

- **Best practice**
  - Always use `declare -A`
  - Quote keys and values
  - When iterating, explicitly sort keys if order matters

### **5. Readonly (Constant) Variables**
For configuration-like values.

```bash
declare -r PI=3.14159
declare -r AUTHOR="Alex"
```

- **Best practice**
  - Use `declare -r` (or `readonly`) for constants
  - Write in uppercase by convention for constants (`PI`, `AUTHOR`, etc.)

### **6. Environment Variables**
Variables that are visible to child processes.

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
export APP_ENV="production"
```

- **Best practice**
  - Use `export` only for variables that must be inherited by subprocesses
  - Don’t over-export (avoid polluting environment unnecessarily)

### **7. Local Variables (inside functions)**
To prevent variable leakage between functions.

```bash
my_function() {
    local temp_file="/tmp/data"
    echo "Working with $temp_file"
}
```

- **Best practice**
  - Always use `local` inside functions to avoid overwriting global variables

## **Bash Conditional Syntax and Symbol Reference**

### **1. `[ ]` — POSIX Test Command**
The single brackets `[` and `]` are the traditional **test command** used for evaluating conditional expressions.
They are compatible with POSIX shells and support basic **string**, **numeric**, and **file** comparisons.

**Key Points**
* A space must follow `[` and precede `]`.
* Variables should be quoted to avoid word splitting and globbing.
* Returns exit status `0` (true) if the expression evaluates successfully.

**Examples**
```bash
# String comparison
if [ "$user" = "admin" ]; then
    echo "Access granted."
fi

# Numeric comparison
if [ "$age" -lt 18 ]; then
    echo "Underage user."
fi

# File test
if [ -f "/etc/passwd" ]; then
    echo "File exists."
fi
```

**Common Operators**

| Type    | Operator    | Description                        |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| String  | `=`         | Strings are equal                  |
| String  | `!=`        | Strings are not equal              |
| Numeric | `-eq`       | Equal to                           |
| Numeric | `-ne`       | Not equal to                       |
| Numeric | `-lt`       | Less than                          |
| Numeric | `-le`       | Less than or equal to              |
| Numeric | `-gt`       | Greater than                       |
| Numeric | `-ge`       | Greater than or equal to           |
| File    | `-f file`   | True if file exists and is regular |
| File    | `-d dir`    | True if directory exists           |
| File    | `-r file`   | File is readable                   |
| File    | `-w file`   | File is writable                   |
| File    | `-x file`   | File is executable                 |
| String  | `-z "$var"` | True if string is empty            |
| String  | `-n "$var"` | True if string is not empty        |

### **2. `[[ ]]` — Bash Conditional Expression**
The double brackets `[[` and `]]` are the **enhanced conditional test** used in Bash and Korn shell.
They provide improved safety, additional operators, and simplified syntax.

**Advantages**
- No need to quote variables (prevents word splitting and globbing automatically).
- Supports logical operators `&&`, `||`, and `!`.
- Enables **pattern matching** (`==` and `!=`) and **regex matching** (`=~`).

**Examples**

```bash
# String comparison
if [[ $name == "Alex" ]]; then
    echo "Welcome, Alex."
fi

# Logical operators
if [[ $age -ge 18 && $age -lt 30 ]]; then
    echo "Young adult."
fi

# Pattern matching
if [[ $file == *.txt ]]; then
    echo "Text file detected."
fi

# Regular expression
if [[ $email =~ ^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}$ ]]; then
    echo "Valid email format."
fi
```

**Notes**
- `[[ ]]` is Bash-specific and not POSIX compliant.
- It is recommended for modern Bash scripts because it handles variables more safely.

<br>

### **3. `(( ))` — Arithmetic Evaluation**
The `(( ))` construct is used for **arithmetic expressions**.
It supports integer operations without requiring `$` for variable expansion.

**Key Points**
- Evaluates arithmetic directly (no `expr` command needed).
- Returns exit status `0` if the result is non-zero (true).
- Supports increment/decrement and standard math operators.

**Examples**
```bash
# Simple arithmetic
(( sum = a + b ))

# Conditional arithmetic test
if (( a + b > 10 )); then
    echo "Sum exceeds 10."
fi

# Increment and loop
count=0
while (( count < 5 )); do
    echo "Count: $count"
    ((count++))
done
```

**Supported Operators**
`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `++`, `--`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
